## Variables & Data Types.<a name="Topic1"></a>

*you don't need to declare Data type in java.*

**var**<a name="Topic1.1"></a> : `var` is used to declare a value in a variable, you can change them by assigning value.
          You can change `var` by again declaring same variable name.
          if you do mistakenly in large code, it is difficult to identify.

**let**<a name="Topic1.2"></a> : `let` is same as var but `let` can be declared once, if you declare a `let` more than once, error will showen.

**const**<a name="Topic1.3"></a> : `cont` is only once declared you can't change value of `const` by assigning.


#### NOTES:-

>Use `const` to declare value for first time, to reduce errors.
