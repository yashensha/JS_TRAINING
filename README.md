## Variables & Data Types.

*you don't need to declare Data type in java.*

**var** : `var` is used to declare a value in a variable, you can change             them by assigning value.
          You can change `var` by again declaring same variable name.
          if you do mistakenly in large code, it is difficult to identify.

**let** : `let` is same as var but `let` can be declared once, if you                  declare a `let` more than once, error will showen.
